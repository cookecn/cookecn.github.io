                Hello! My name is Colby Cooke and I am learning how to code! I hail from the 
                great state of Virginia, in a small town named Goochland. It was so small that
                we only had one stop-light in the entire town! There were sports, and clubs, but 
                most importantly there were friendships. Everyone knew everyone, literally. 
            </p>

            <p>
                After I graduated from Goochland High School I attended Vanderbilt University and
                played collegiate football. During college I learned a lot about who I was and wanted
                to become. Now i'm here, doing what I want to do. Now you know a little bit about me!
